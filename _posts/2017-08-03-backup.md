This is the home page, temporarily just to show the capabilities of mark down.

Now this is a command you may want to try if you are the owner of a unix system

    sudo rm -rf /

Not happy with the result? the best answer I could find on internet?

Set up a regularly backup to an external disk!!

But what is the best tool, dir/file structure for this?

Well this is the post to answer that question.

> Snapshots vs incremental.
> Tools for specific data (photos, videos, documents, code...)
> Custom configuration.
> File system
